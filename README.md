# Monte-Carlo-Estimation-using-NumPy
This project estimates the value of π using the Monte Carlo method implemented in Python with NumPy. It randomly generates points in a unit square and determines how many fall inside the unit circle to approximate π. Demonstrates NumPy's vectorization, random sampling, and boolean masking features.
